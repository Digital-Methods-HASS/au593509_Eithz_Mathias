In this repository are the scripts and data used for comparing the 2013 and the 2021 NATO Secretary General's Annual Report via text mining and
sentiment analysis using the AFINN- and the NRC general purpose lexica. This is placed in the folder "Digital Project".
Additionally, in the folder "Homework Assignments" there is a copy of my 4 homework assignments and attachments to these.
